i do not wish to know which movies i've seen last year.
or how many steps i've walked last month.
i do not care which artist i've listened to the most.
'my favorite places' list in the map app is now empty.

an lru cache which is my memory provides me with perfectly good suggestions of eigher of those things.

still, some journaling i consider important. 
like keeping a [ledger](https://hledger.org) of my financial history - that is useful sometimes.
