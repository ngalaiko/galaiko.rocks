"A dry martini," Bond said. "One. In a #deep champagne goblet{}." "Oui, monsieur."
"Just a moment. Three measures of @Gordon's{45%ml}, one of @vodka{15%ml}, half a measure of @Kina Lillet{7.5%ml}. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a @large thin slice of lemon peel{1}. Got it?"

-- Instead of Kina Lillet, use Lillet Blanc or Cocchi Americano.
