	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<h2>Hosting</h2>
	<p>
		First thing to know, this website is hosted on <a
			data-sveltekit-reload
			href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a
		>. It means that all your requests go through their servers and
		<a data-sveltekit-reload href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy"
			>Vercels's Privacy policy</a
		> is applied.
	</p>

	<h2>JavaScript</h2>
	<p>
		This website is build with <a data-sveltekit-reload href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> and
		by default uses JavaScript to act like a Single Page Application for enhanced user expirience.
	</p>

	<p>
		With that said, the website is fully functional without JavaScript if you don't want to use it.
	</p>

	<h2>Analytics</h2>
	<p>
		I have vercel collecting, <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/analytics/audiences"
			>audiences</a
		> analytics.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can see all the data it has on the
		<a href="https://umami.galaiko.rocks/share/6GLJwDAP/galaiko.rocks">public dashboard</a>. If you
		don't want to be tracked, make sure your browser has 'Do not track' preference enabled.
	</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>No cookies usage.</p>

	<h2>Source</h2>
	<p>
		You can find the website's source code on <a
