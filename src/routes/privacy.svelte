	<strong>Hosting</strong>
	<p>
		First thing to know, this website is hosted on <a
			sveltekit:reload
			href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a
		>. It means that all your requests go through their servers and
		<a sveltekit:reload href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/"
			>Cloudflare'd Privacy policy</a
		> is applied.
	</p>

	<strong>JavaScript</strong>
	<p>
		This website is build with <a sveltekit:reload href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> and by
		default uses JavaScript to act like a Single Page Application to enhance user expirience.
	</p>

	<p>
		Also, Cloudflare is injecting a small amount of JavaScript that allows me to see some web
		analytics.
	</p>

	<p>
		With that said, the website is fully functional without JavaScript if you don't want to use it.
