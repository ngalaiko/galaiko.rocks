i do not wish to know which movies i've seen last year.
or how many steps i've walked last month.
i do not care which artist i've listened to the most.
i've removed all bookmarks and do not plan to use it again.

accumulating useless information like that only stresses me and is not useful at all.
i usually rememeber what i actually liked and will use that from now on.

still, some journaling i consider important.
like keeping a [ledger](https://hledger.org) of my financial history - that is useful.
