i was just about to go outside to grap something to eat.
and while i was putting my hat on (because it's winter outside), it hit me with a perfect description of a what an ideal haircut is to me.
here it goes:

1. it must fit inside my hat

   right now i have a little too much of hairs to fit inside the hat.
   it kind of feels like i am stuffing the hat with hairs a little bit - that i'd like to avoid

2. when i take my hat off, the hairs should already be good

   i don't want to think about how i look just after i take my hat off.
   i'd like it to be exactly as i looked when i left my home

normally, this limits me quite a bit in terms of the hair length.
i just never realised i prefer shorter haircuts because the place i grew up in gets cold.
