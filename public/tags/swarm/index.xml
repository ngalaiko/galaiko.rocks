      <description>The idea of a peer to peer something is to create a system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any centralized server to operate. In the case of a messenger, two users should be able to communicate directly between each other until at least one of their instances is running.
That&amp;rsquo;s why the most important part of such systems is a discovery. If peers can&amp;rsquo;t find each other, it&amp;rsquo;s useless.
The first problem is to build a messenger app, that can discover the same apps in the network and securely communicate with each other.</description>
