      <description>Last week I participated in a small competiotion at work. The goal was to calculate the top 10 the most common words in a file and print them with number of occurences. For testing we used export from HackerNews comments from 2012 until today, and that file was 4GB.
I will describe what optimizations I used to solve the problem from the most to the least obvious.
Solution was measured on MacBook Pro 2018 with 2,2 GHz Intel Core i7 CPU and 32 GB RAM.</description>

      <description>In the golang community slack, someone shared a link to a package used to validate Swedish personnumer. Personnumer is a swedish version of an ID, and its format is well defined:
 First 6 or 8 digits is a birthrate with or without a century. Last four digits are random secret digits. The whole number satisfies the Luhn algorithm. Birthdate and secret digits can be divided with - or +.  For example 19900101-0017</description>
