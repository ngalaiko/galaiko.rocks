> These kefir pancakes are as fluffy as Winnie the Pooh! The secret is in the technique - don't overmix after adding baking soda.

Warm @kefir{250%ml} with @water{40%ml} until just lukewarm.

In a #large bowl{} mix @egg{1}, @sugar{3%tbsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp}. Add the warm kefir mixture and stir to combine.

Add @flour{240%g} and mix until just combined - don't overmix.

Add @baking soda{1/2%tsp} and gently fold in. Once soda is added, do not stir anymore - this is the secret to fluffy pancakes!

> The secret trick: after adding baking soda, stop mixing completely to keep the pancakes incredibly fluffy.

Heat @vegetable oil{} in a #frying pan{} over medium heat. Spoon batter into pan to form small round pancakes.

Fry until golden brown on both sides, about ~{2-3%minutes} per side.

> Serve hot with sour cream, jam, or honey for a traditional Russian breakfast.
