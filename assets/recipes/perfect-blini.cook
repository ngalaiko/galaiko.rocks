title: Perfect Blini
---

> These are smooth pancakes with no holes. Very balanced in taste. They don't tear, hold their shape well, but aren't rubbery. Perfect for filling or eating plain with your favorite toppings. Super simple to make - even a child can fry them.

Melt @butter{35%g} if using butter option.

> For crispy edges use all butter. For softer edges use 20g vegetable oil + 15g melted butter.

In a #large bowl{} combine half of @milk{250%g}(room temperature or warm) with @eggs{2}, @sugar{35%g}, @salt{3%g}, and @flour{190%g}. Whisk quickly until mixture reaches thick sour cream consistency.

Slowly pour in remaining @milk{250%g}, whisking continuously. Add the melted butter and @vegetable oil{20%g}(if using oil option) at the end.

Heat a #frying pan{} over medium heat. Pour batter to form thin pancakes and cook until golden on both sides.

> The batter should be smooth with no lumps. Let it rest for a few minutes before cooking if needed.
