if you are using vim daily now, it must be feeling great.
it certanly does for me.
but some time in the past i had to hammer that skill down into my muscules, and that was fun by iteself.

it is hard to describe the feeling i had learning vim.
but it is definately the same feeling i have now when i ride on a fixed gear bike.

to be doing a mundain activity with foreign tools captures a lot of attention.
and it is surprisingly pleasent to pay nearly all the attention to the present moment.

constantly remembering which mode i am in now and all the shortkeys,
or asessing traffic and people around because i can not stop fast enough.

i think that is what buddist monks mean when they talk about "living in the present moment".
there is no past or a future, only me and a that traffic light ahead that i should either race now or slow down and wait.

but that feeling flees.
i do not have it with vim at all now, after many years.
and i have it less and less on my bike every day.

i would like to keep it for a long as i can.
