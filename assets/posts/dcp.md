Recently found this website [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/]),
where you can subscribe to a newsletter and get one problem a day.

For a long time, I wanted to start solving problems from leetcode to keep fit,
but could never begin.

Also, for a long time, I wanted to start a blog, but could never begin.

Writing short articles about how I solve these problems seems for me as an excellent
opportunity to start doing both, so every day I will publish my solution for
the daily problem here, and to [my GitHub](https://github.com/ngalayko/dcp) page trying to explain why and how I solved it.
